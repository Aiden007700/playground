    <h1>the "display" property</h1>
    <p>
      display is CSS's most important property for controlling layout.
       Every element has a default display value depending on what type of element
        it is. The default for most elements is usually <code>block</code> or <code>inline</code>.
         A block  element is often called a block-level element. An inline element is always
        just called an inline element.
    </p>
    <h2>block</h2>
    <div class="border">
      div is the standard block-level element. A block-level element starts on a new
       line and stretches out to the left and right as far as it can. Other common
       block-level elements are p and form, and new in HTML5 are header, footer,
       section, and more.
    </div>
    <h2>inline</h2>
    <p>
    <code>span</code> is the standard inline element. An inline element can wrap some text
    inside a paragraph <span id="span"> <span id="span1">&lt;span&gt;</span> like this <span id="span1">&lt;/span&gt;</span></span> without disrupting the flow of
     that paragraph. The a element is the most common inline element, since you use
     them for links.
    </p>
    <h2>none</h2>
    <p>
      Another common display value is <code>none</code>. Some specialized elements such as script
       use this as their default. It is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show
       elements without really deleting and recreating them.

  This is different from <code>visibility</code>. Setting <code>display</code> to <code>none</code> will render the page as
  though the element does not exist. <code>visibility: hidden;</code> will hide the element, but the
  element will still take up the space it would if it was fully visible.
    </p>
    <h2>other display values</h2>
    <p>
      There are plenty of more exotic display values, such as <code>list-item</code> and <code>table</code>.
      <a>Here is an exhaustive list</a>. We'll discuss <code>inline-block</code> and <code>flex</code> later on.
    </p>
    <h2>extra credit</h2>
    <p>
      As I mentioned, every element has a default display type. However, you can
       always override this! Though it wouldn't make sense to make an inline div,
        you can use this to customize the display of elements that have particular
         semantics. A common example is making inline <code>li</code> elements for horizontal menus.
